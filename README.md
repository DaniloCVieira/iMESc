# iMESc: Interactive Machine Learning App for Environmental Sciences

iMESc is a state-of-the-art application designed to bring the power of machine learning to environmental science. Through its interactive interface, it facilitates a more intuitive and seamless experience for users to engage with complex data sets and analysis processes.

## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Install R and RStudio
If you haven't already, install R and RStudio by following the instructions on their respective websites.

### Step 2: Open RStudio
Once R and RStudio are installed, open RStudio.

### Step 3: Install Shiny Package
Install the shiny package if it's not already installed. You can do this by running the following command in the RStudio console:
```r
install.packages('shiny')
```
### Step 4: Run iMESc

To start using the iMESc app, run the following code in the RStudio console:
```r
shiny::runGitHub('iMESc','DaniloCVieira', ref='main')
```
Note: When you use the iMESc app for the first time, it will automatically install all the necessary packages, which may take several minutes to complete. However, once the first installation is finished, subsequent access of the app will be much faster. If the required packages are not already loaded, they typically take several seconds to load. On the other hand, if the packages are already loaded, iMESc will start almost instantly.

## Desktop Version for Windows Users

If you are a Windows user, you can enhance your experience with the standalone iMESc desktop version. Visit the [iMESc-Desktop repository](https://github.com/DaniloCVieira/iMESc-Desktop) to find more details and download the installer.
